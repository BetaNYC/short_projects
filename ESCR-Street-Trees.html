          <span>The</span>
          East Coast Resiliency Project (ESCR) represents a once-in-a-lifetime
          opportunity to provide our coastal communities with reliable protection
          from the rising seas and storm surge that will come with climate change.
          Superstorm Sandy, which struck New York City a decade ago, demonstrated
          how vulnerable we are to the effects of extreme weather, especially as
          some recovery projects are still underway.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          <span>In</span>
          addition to enhancing protection from weather, the project will address
          decades of environmental inaction from the government and provide a park
          that will be enjoyed by generations to come.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          <span>As</span>
          part of negotiations, my office helped secure meaningful improvements
          for the park and surrounding communities, including the commitment by
          the Department of Parks and Recreation to plan 1,000 street trees- a
          goal the Department is set to exceed. A full list of the secured
          commitments can be found here:

          <span>This</span> map shows all of the trees that have been planted as
          part of the ESCR agreement, through the Fall 2022 planting season. The
          map will be updated at the end of the Spring planting season. The
          Department of Parks and Recreation is still surveying for the Spring
          2023 tree locations through March.
